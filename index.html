    Join the student-run film festival dedicated to helping teenage creatives
    find their voice in Philadelphia's community of young filmmakers.

    This festival is a great opportunity to show off work and get critiques,
    as well as to network with peers from the area and make connections.
    Filmmaking experts will judge and rank submitted films in four categories:
    narrative, documentary, experimental, and screenplay. At each festival,
    we offer several workshops on a variety of common and niche filmmaking focuses.
